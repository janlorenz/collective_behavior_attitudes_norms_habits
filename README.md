# collective_behavior_attitudes_norms_habits 

NetLogo model and reproducible data generation and analysis code for the paper

"How small attitudinal preferences can translate into big society-level outcomes"

`collective_behavior_attitudes_norms_habits .nlogo` NetLogo model which

    - runs example simulations
    - run exactly the simulations used for figures
    - can produce the large datasets in the data directory with the help of Behavior Space (takes some days!)
    - can write out a snapshot of the current agents utility terms

`analysis.R` makes some aggregate figures with the large datasets in the data directory

`regression_individuals.R` makes analysis of snapshots of agents
